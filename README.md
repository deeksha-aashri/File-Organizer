# File-Organizer
The node.js project
This is my second node.js project. It helps us to organize our files with the help of three commands. Kindly find the readme file for details. 
Commands:
1- node main.js help => This command gives us the list of all the commands which may be used, according to our need.
2- node main.js organize filepath => This command creates a folder known as organized_files at the given path and categorizes our files as per their extensions.
3- node main.js tree filepath => This command creates a tree of the files and folders contained at the given filepath where each branch is a folder, the sub-branches represent the files inside the said folder.   

Note: The tree command involves recursion.
