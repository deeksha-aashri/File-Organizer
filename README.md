# File-Organizer</br>
The node.js project</br>
This is my second node.js project. It helps us to organize our files with the help of three commands.</br>
Kindly go through the readme file for details.</br>. 
Commands:</br>
1- node main.js help => This command gives us the list of all the commands which may be used, according to our need.</br>
2- node main.js organize filepath => This command creates a folder known as organized_files at the given path and categorizes our files as per their extensions.</br>
3- node main.js tree filepath => This command creates a tree of the files and folders contained at the given filepath where each branch is a folder, the sub-branches represent the files inside the said folder.</br>   

Note: The tree command involves the use recursion.</br>
